# Flask-Based Finances Platform 

**Note:** This is a mock-up - no "buying" and "selling" of stocks is real, though the stocks are live. Upon registration, each user receives "$10,000" (not real).

In HTML, CSS, and Python (Flask)  - This project brought mixes together flask, python, html, css and SQL. I created a flask-based web platform where new users can register and log in to view, buy and sell live stocks. The web application is supported through a sqlite database that keeps track of users, stocks and transactions.
